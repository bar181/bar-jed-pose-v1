# Current Pose Detection Implementation Analysis

## Overview
The bar-jed-pose-v1 project is a computer vision application that overlays pose detection on video streams. Based on the core-concepts.md, the project has ambitious plans for significant enhancements.

## Current Architecture
- **Single-person tracking**: Currently limited to one person at a time
- **JavaScript-based**: Running entirely in the browser
- **Basic pose detection**: Using standard models without optimization
