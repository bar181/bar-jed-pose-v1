# COCO Pose Detection: Key Findings & Quick Reference

## üèÜ Top Models for Production Use

### Best Overall Accuracy
**ViTPose (ViTAE-G, ensemble)** - 81.1% AP
- Transformer-based, requires significant compute
- Best for: Research, offline processing

### Best Real-Time Performance  
**YOLO-NAS-Pose** - 59.7-76.8% AP @ 30-120 FPS
- Neural Architecture Search optimized
- Best for: Production applications, real-time systems

### Best for Crowded Scenes
**RSN (Residual Steps Network)** - 79.2% AP
- Current SOTA for multi-person scenarios
- Best for: Surveillance, crowd analysis

## üìä Critical Metrics to Track

1. **AP (Average Precision)** - Primary metric, average over OKS thresholds 0.5-0.95
2. **AP50** - Good for general accuracy (OKS=0.5)
3. **AP75** - Tests precise localization (OKS=0.75)
4. **FPS** - Frames per second for real-time requirements

## üéØ Quick Decision Guide

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Why |
|----------|------------------|-----|
| Sports Analytics | ViTPose or HRNet | High precision needed |
| Mobile/Edge | YOLO-NAS-Pose-N | 120+ FPS, small model |
| General Production | YOLO-NAS-Pose-M | Balanced performance |
| Research/Benchmarking | ViTPose ensemble | State-of-the-art accuracy |
| Crowded Scenes | OpenPose or RSN | Better multi-person handling |

## ‚ö° Performance Reference

- **Real-time threshold**: 30 FPS minimum
- **COCO average**: 2.3 persons per image
- **Keypoints**: 17 body joints per person
- **Occlusion rate**: ~40% of keypoints

## üîß Implementation Tips

1. **Start with pre-trained models** - Don't train from scratch
2. **Use OKS for evaluation** - Standard COCO metric
3. **Consider top-down for accuracy**, bottom-up for speed
4. **Apply NMS post-processing** to remove duplicates
5. **Test on multiple scales** - COCO has high variance

## üìà 2024 Trends

- **Transformers dominating** accuracy benchmarks
- **Real-time models** closing accuracy gap
- **3D pose estimation** gaining traction
- **Whole-body estimation** (beyond 17 keypoints) emerging

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Download COCO-Pose dataset
2. Choose framework: MMPose (comprehensive) or YOLO (simple)
3. Start with YOLO-NAS-Pose-S for balanced performance
4. Evaluate using official COCO API
5. Fine-tune on your specific use case
