## Evaluation Methodologies

### Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS)

The primary evaluation metric for pose estimation on COCO is OKS, calculated as:

```
OKS = Σᵢ exp(-dᵢ²/2s²kᵢ²)δ(vᵢ>0) / Σᵢ δ(vᵢ>0)
```

Where:
- `dᵢ` = Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth keypoint
- `s` = Object scale (square root of bounding box area)
- `kᵢ` = Per-keypoint constant controlling falloff
- `vᵢ` = Visibility flag of keypoint i
- `δ` = Indicator function

### Average Precision Metrics

1. **AP (AP@OKS=.50:.05:.95)**
   - Primary metric
   - Average over 10 OKS thresholds
   - Most comprehensive evaluation

2. **AP50 (AP@OKS=.50)**
   - Looser criterion
   - Good for general accuracy assessment

3. **AP75 (AP@OKS=.75)**
   - Stricter criterion
   - Tests precise localization

4. **APM (AP for medium objects)**
   - Area: 32² < area < 96²
   - Tests mid-range detection

5. **APL (AP for large objects)**
   - Area: area > 96²
   - Tests large person detection

### Average Recall Metrics

- **AR**: Average Recall at 10 detections per image
- **ARM**: AR for medium objects
- **ARL**: AR for large objects

## Multi-Person Pose Detection Approaches

### 1. Top-Down Approaches
**Process**: Detect persons → Estimate pose for each
- **Advantages**: 
  - Higher accuracy per person
  - Easier to implement

  - Dependent on detector quality
- **Examples**: HRNet, Uniformer, ViTPose

### 2. Bottom-Up Approaches
**Process**: Detect all keypoints → Group into persons
- **Advantages**:
  - Constant runtime regardless of # people
  - Better for crowded scenes
  - Single-stage processing
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex grouping algorithms
  - Lower individual accuracy
- **Examples**: OpenPose, HigherHRNet, DEKR

### 3. Single-Stage Approaches
